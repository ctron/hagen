Hagen is a static website generator, written the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's goal is
to be flexible and extensible, making it possible to generate all kinds of web sites, not only blogs. 

Hagen can be run out of the box, there is no need to write code. The easiest way to run it is using the container:

    docker run quay.io/ctron/hagen --rm -ti
